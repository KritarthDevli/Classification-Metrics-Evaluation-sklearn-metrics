# Classification Metrics Evaluator

This Python project demonstrates how to calculate key classification metrics using scikit-learn. It uses a simple example to compute and display the following metrics for model evaluation:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

These metrics are crucial for evaluating the performance of classification models, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when optimizing for specific performance criteria.

## Description

In this project, we use the `scikit-learn` library to calculate and display classification metrics. The project includes a simple example with a set of true labels (`y_true`) and predicted labels (`y_pred`). You can modify these values to test the metrics with your own data.

The classification metrics computed are:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python and the `scikit-learn` library installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:
